# Learning Repository

> This repository was created for educational and learning proporses.

This repository was created by me as part of an online course on Repository for the course **Machine Learning & Data Science with Python**. This course was delivered by Jones Granatyr and hosted at Udemy. It can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/machine-learning-e-data-science-com-python-y/ "Machine Learning e Data Science with Python").

This repository will be used to host the **IPython Notebook** writed throughout the course.

After the end of the course, this repository will be archieve and keeped as read-only.

Comments and suggestions are welcome,

Thank you,
